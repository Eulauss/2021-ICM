# 2021-ICM
In memory of the 10 day struggle of 2021 ICM, I played the role of coding and modeling, some visualization.

## mock test: we complished the problem of big data analysis
I have uploaded the codes of mock test.

## 2021ICM: we choose problem D, which has to do with gragh algorithm, network optimalization, as well as data mining (2021 ICM).
I made use of Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, NetworkX, sklearn for coding, and Visio matpotlib, Highchart for visualization.
